Red-Black Trees (\textit{RBT}) are Binary Search Trees \textit({BST}) in which every node contains one additional information: its color,
which can either be red or black.
Compared to BSTs, RBTs guarantee that basic dynamic-set operations take at most $O(log_2 \ n)$.
In a RBT, keys are stored in internal nodes, and leaves as well as the parent of the root are replaced
by a sentinel node \textbf{NIL}.
RBTs are BSTs that satisfy the following Red-Black properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each node is either \textit{red} or \textit{black}.
    \item The root is \textit{black}.
    \item All leaves (NIL) are \textit{black}.
    \item If a node is \textit{red}, then both its children are \textit{black}.
    \item All simple paths from a node to a leaf contain the same number of \textit{black} nodes.
\end{enumerate}
The number of nodes on any simple path from a node \textit{x} (excluded) down to a leaf is called
\textbf{black-height} of x, or \textbf{b-height}, denoted by $bh(x)$. \newline
The black-height of the tree is the black-height of the root. \newline \newline
\textbf{LEMMA}: A RBT with $n$ internal nodes has a height at most $2 \ log_2(n + 1)$ \newline \newline
    \textbf{Proof}: \newline
We first prove by induction that any subtree with root $x$ has at least $2^{bh(x)} - 1$ internal nodes.
If the height is 0, then x is a leaf, therefore it has $2^0 - 1 = 0$ internal nodes. \newline
Any internal node x has 2 children, both of which have a black-height of either $bh(x)$ or $bh(x) - 1$
depending if its red or black, respectively. \newline
Therefore, each child has at least $2^{bh(x) - 1} - 1$ internal nodes, thus the subtree rooted at x
as at least: \newline
    $((2^{bh(x) - 1} - 1) + (2^{bh(x) - 1} - 1) + 1)$ \textit{(both children + the root itself)} = \newline \newline
$2^1 \ 2^{bh(x) - 1} - 2 + 1$ = $2^{bh(x) - 1}- 1$. \newline \newline
According to property \textit{(4)}, at least half of the nodes from the root down to a leaf must be black,
therefore, the b-height of the root must be at least $2^{\frac{h}{2}} - 1$: \newline
$n \geq 2^{\frac{h}{2}} - 1$ \newline \newline
$n + 1 \geq 2^{\frac{h}{2}}$ \newline \newline
$log_2(n + 1) \geq \frac{h}{2}$ \newline \newline
\textbf{$h \leq 2 log_2(n + 1)$} \newline \newline \newline
Insertion and Deletion in a RBT may lead to violations of the Red-Black properties. \newline
In order to restore such properties, we need to
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Change the pointer structure of the tree
        \item Change the color of some nodes
    \end{enumerate}
We change the pointer structure through \textit{rotations}, which may either be \textit{left rotations}
    or \textit{right rotations}. \newline
In the left rotation of a Node \textit{x}, we assume its right child \textit{y} to be $\neq NIL$, \textit{x} then
    becomes \textit{y}'s left child, and \textit{y}'s left child becomes \textit{x}'s right child. \newline
    The \textit{right rotation} is completely symmetric. \newline
Rotations run in $O(1)$ time, because only pointers are changed by them while other attributes in a node
    remain the same. \newline \newline \newline
\textbf{Insertions} \newline \newline
We can insert a node in a RBT in $O(\log(n))$ time.
To do so, we first insert the new node \textit{Z} in the RBT as if it were a normal BST, we then color \textit{Z} red.
Since this insertion may violate the \textit{Red-Black properties} we call an auxiliary procedure \textit{insertFixup}
to recolor nodes and performs rotations. \newline
There are four cases to consider: since we added a \textit{red} node, the only properties that the insertion may violate
are \textit{(2)} and \textit{(4)}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If the tree violates property \textit{(2)}, then \textit{Z} is the root, which is the only internal
    node of the tree.
    Since its parent and children are sentinels, property \textit{(4)} cannot be violated, therefore, we simply recolor
    \textit{Z} as black.
    \item If the \textit{Z}'s uncle is red, then the tree violates property \textit{(4)}, therefore, we recolor
    \textit{Z}'s uncle, parent and grandparent.
    \item If \textit{Z}'s uncle is black, and either \textit{Z}'s parent is a right child and \textit{Z} is a left child
    OR \textit{Z}'s parent is a left child and \textit{Z} is a right child, we rotate \textit{Z}'s parent in
    the opposite direction of \textit{Z}.
    \item If \textit{Z}'s uncle is black, and both \textit{Z}'s parent and \textit{Z} are right children OR
    both \textit{Z}'s parent and \textit{Z} are left children, we rotate \textit{Z}'s grandparent in the opposite
    direction of \textit{Z}, we then recolor the original parent and grandparent of \textit{Z}.
\end{enumerate}
    Insertion in a RBT has a time complexity of $O(\log(n))$. \newline
    The basic inserting operation takes $O(\log(n))$, we then perform $\log(n)$ recolors and rotations,
    which take $O(1)$ time. \newline
