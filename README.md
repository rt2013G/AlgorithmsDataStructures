# Algorithms and Data Structures
A repository which stores the code for my Algorithms and Data Structures university course, with the purpose of being both a compendium and reference for myself.
This repository will contain both code in C++ for the algorithms and data structures implementations, as well as various additional notes concerning theory and comments on said code.
